# LME_MixedEffectsERPTutorial
This GitHub page contains linear mixed effects model (LME) resources and scripts from Heise, Mon, and Bowman (2022):

* **LMEIntroResources**: List of recommended introductory textbooks, papers, and websites for linear mixed effects models. 

* **LMETutorialScripts**: Tutorial pipeline for processing continuous EEG data files and calculating trial-level ERP waveforms in MATLAB. Mean amplitude values are then exported into R and analyzed with LME models. This pipeline was described in Appendix D of Heise et al. (2022). 

* **SimulationScripts**: Pipeline for simulating developmental ERP data with realistic data missingness patterns. Script parameters (e.g., age-related mean amplitude difference, neural noise characteristics) and supplemental analyses were reported in Section 3 and Appendix B of Heise et al. (2022).
